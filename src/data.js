The best-known hypothesis for the origin of the name Montreal is that the name is taken from Mount Royal. The hill is part of the Monteregian Hills situated between the Laurentians and the Appalachian Mountains. It gave its Latin name, Mons Regius, to the Monteregian chain. The hill consists of three peaks: Colline de la Croix at 233 m, Colline d'Outremont at 211 m, and Westmount Summit at 201 m elevation above mean sea level. ",
